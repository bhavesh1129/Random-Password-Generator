In today’s world, when every thing ranging from social media to bank transactions are online, there is a need to protect one’s privacy and security. 
Password protection is provided by each website or portal we visit today but it is important that the password not be something that can be easily decoded.
A strong password should consist of:
i.	Uppercase letters
ii.	Lowercase letters
iii.Numbers
iv.	Symbols 
More often than not, we don’t make an effort to think of a difficult password and end up using our phone numbers or birth dates as one. 
This does nothing except making our online profiles, bank account information etc. unsafe and easy to hack.
To provide a hassle-free solution to this, we have created this Random Password Generator. 
It gives the user the freedom to select the categories such as length and password requirements and creates a safe password according to the user’s needs. 
The user can select any ‘Length’ varying from 8 to 15 characters and further select the requirements for the password from the ‘Settings’ section. 
All one has to do now is to click on the ‘Generate Password’ button located at the bottom of the mobile-like look of this model. 
The user will be provided with a password in a fraction of seconds. 
This password will also be available for the user to copy from our site without any trouble. 
The user can generate as many passwords as he/she wants to ensure the safety of his/her profiles in the virtual world.
